#### Imperium constellation is a third-person view mass shooter game in which you play as an independent interplanetary battleship pilot who joins the coalitions force composed of 3 races: alien, robot and human. 

This coalitions fights against a new invader: the Imperium.
They threaten to destroy all the solar systems in their path and you must stop them. 

The game is divided into two phases. During the first phase, when you are on the allied base, you can improve your ship by changing its elements to modify its characteristics (ex: change the type of weapons).
Each race has its own modules with their own advantage/disadvantage and with a unique visual appearance.
You can also completely change your hub. It is the central part of the ship on which you come to attach the modules.
Again, each race has its own hubs. Some have several categories of hubs to offer you!

In the second phase, you will find yourself on the battlefield with your allies.
Your objective is then simple: repel the attack of the Imperium by all means.
The fate of the coalitions' solar systems is in your hands.
